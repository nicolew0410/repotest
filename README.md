# To make a REPO:
1. Cd into the right place and make a directory 
2. Create a README file by using "touch README.md"
3. Go inside the README and type something in it (It may matter or not depending)
4. Save the README & exit 
5. Add the file by using git add README.md
6. Then commit with a message by using "git commit -m "(message)""(Messagemust be in quotations)
7. After that, go to your github and make a new repository name (prefarably the same name as your directory) and click create.
8. After making that, copy the 2nd line of code aka:git remote add origin git@github.com:nicolew0410/repotest.git and git push -u origin master
9. Finally, check if it has updated in the right place. And you're done!
